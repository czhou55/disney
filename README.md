# Disney Project

Disney has long established itself as a mogul in animation and family-friendly movies
from the early stages of animation in the entertainment industry. However, recent metrics on
Strange World and Lightyear were recorded as some of Disney’s worst opening weekends ever.
This project hopes to reveal insights and discover factors that lead to Disney films’ high profits.
We predict that movie factors such as characters, revenues, and genres are key elements that
result in a successful Disney movie that the audiences enjoy. Therefore, we would like to explore
these questions: do Disney characters directly translate into higher earnings for Disney? If not,
what other factors lead to Disney’s higher earnings?
